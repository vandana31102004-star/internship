    "print(\"Machine Learning is a way of teaching computers to learn from data instead of giving them fixed rules. In traditional programming, we provide both the data and the instructions, and the computer gives us the result. But in Machine Learning, we give the computer data along with the correct answers, and it learns the rules by itself. This helps solve complex problems where writing exact rules is difficult.\")"
